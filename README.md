# RefundSploit - LCU API Refund exploit
#
Abuses the fact that you may buy something from the shop in League of Legends

but *until you play with it* - you may **refund** the whole sum (`BE/RP`).
# Proof of concept: 
Buy something, character or skin doesn't even matter, queue up, accept the game
run the `api.py` and magic will happen, now you can play any champion despite
it's not present in your collection.
